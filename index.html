            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Getting to design and create new software and websites with real values was always something that 
                I was drawn towards, and with both a programming and design background, I decided to take the steps 
                to be a frontend developer. I am currently working towards my computer science degree right now, and 
                have been a graphic designer for the last 2 years, working for my university as well as for companies 
                such as Redbull and Riot Games.</p>
